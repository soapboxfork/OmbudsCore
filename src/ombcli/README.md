# ombcli



## Building

This project depends on [go-qml](https://github.com/go-qml/qml#qml-support-for-the-go-language), which might work with go get out of the box.

If you are running Ubuntu you need to the follow the ubuntu specific installation 
[instructions](https://github.com/go-qml/qml#requirements-on-ubuntu)

Since this was developed on QtQuick 5.4 and Ubuntu 14.04 support only reaches QtQuick 5.2. Compiling may not work...

## Note

When building for distrobution remember to reset the qrc:// urls and use go generate.
